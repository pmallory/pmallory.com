My most recent project, [TourStarter](http://tourstarter.pmallory.com/) is feature complete!

The [Adventure Cycling Route Network](http://www.adventurecycling.org/) is a system of scenic and bicycle friendly routes that criss-cross North America.
Their maps are great for planning a tour, but how do you get on a route in the first place?

That's where TourStarter comes in.
Enter your location and TourStarter will find the nearest point on any of Adventure Cycling's 22 routes, and suggest a way to get there using Google Maps' cycling layer.

I have several UI and feature enhancements [planned](https://github.com/pmallory/TourStarter/issues?state=open), but they're on the back burner for now.
[Try it out](http://tourstarter.pmallory.com/) or fork it on [GitHub](https://github.com/pmallory/TourStarter).
