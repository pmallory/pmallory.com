This is my first painting in a long while.
I used white and black paint only for this which made it easy to mix compatible colors but harder to distinguish different elements on the canvas.

I also practiced a receding ridge line in this painting, as seen previously in [Northern California Coast at Night](/northern-california-coast-at-night.html).
If you look at any Bob Ross painting you'll notice the hills and mountains are totally perpendicular to the viewer.
They never look along a valley or along a ridge or anything like that.
This makes them simple to paint but it's really limiting if you want to recreate real places.
To make the ridge recede into the distance I used light values in the distance and gradually darkened it coming forward, while also increasing the size and detail of the textures as I worked towards the foreground.

The big tree was originally going to be some kind of evergreen which is why the trunk is so straight.
