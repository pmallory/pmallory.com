title: Hattie's Hollow
date: 2017-4-22
category: Painting

This painting is a departure from Bob Ross's wet on wet style.
I painted this in four sessions allowing the paint to dry between sessions.
This opens up more possibilities for detail, and it'll be fun to explore this further.

The subject is Hattie's Hollow in Hanging Dog, North Carolina which is where my grandparents lived when I was little.

And here's an animation of how it looked at the end of each painting session:
