title: Northern California Coast at Night
date: 2018-07-05
category: Painting

I used some new brushes in this one: a detail round, a small filbert, and a new blender.
Lots of new strokes in this one.

The dark patch in the sky below the moon has a fun explanation.
I rested my pinkie on the canvas while highlighting the moon, and that left a fingerprint in the sky.
I forgot to blend that out, and only remembered hours later when I was finished and had already cleaned my brushes.
The painting was already beginning to dry by then.
So I mixed up some more sky color and blended it into the already dry paint.

Or maybe that's a gap in the clouds I put there on purpose.
There are no mistakes, just happy accidents.

And this animation shows how the painting came together.
Notice how the colors are different in each frame; I have no idea how to properly photograph a dark painting.
None of the photographs actually look like the painting, you'll just have to see it in person to know what it really looks like.
