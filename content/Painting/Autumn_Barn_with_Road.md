title: Autumn Barn with Road
date: 2019-07-04
category: Painting

In my first painting in a long time, I revisit the barn with autumn colors theme.
I painted this over three days, unlike most of my paintings which I do in one day.
This is a bit tricky, since the paint dried between sessions I couldn't blend new details into the already dry paint.
I would up having to paint some things multiple times (the grassy hill on the right and the middle strip of the road).
I think multi-day painting makes more detailed paintings possible, but I need to be more deliberate about where I quit each day to avoid wasting time and paint.
