title: About Me

Hello, I'm Philip Mallory and this is my web site!
I study computer science at [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu/). I also work
at [ALTA Language Services](http://www.altalang.com/) during alternating
semesters where I do web development and other general programming stuff. You
can check out my code at [GitHub](https://github.com/pmallory).

You can contact me at philip [at] pmallory [dot] com

<h1>About This Site</h1>
This site <del>is</del> was a bunch of static pages generated by a Python script I wrote,
[viewable at GitHub](https://github.com/pmallory/StaticSite).
Now it's generated by [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.1.1/) which is nearly a feature for feature match of what I was working towards.
