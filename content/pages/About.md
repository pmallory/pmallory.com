title: About Me

Hello, I'm Philip Mallory and this is my web site!
I teach backend web development at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com).
I studied computer science at [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu/) which was great and I'd recommend it to anyone.
You can check out my code at [GitHub](https://github.com/pmallory).

<h1>About This Site</h1>
This site <del>is</del> was a bunch of static pages generated by a Python script I wrote,
[viewable at GitHub](https://github.com/pmallory/StaticSite).
Now it's generated by [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.1.1/) which is nearly a feature for feature match of what I was working towards.
