#Seveneves - Neal Stephenson
If you've read and enjoyed other books by Neal Stephenson you'll probably enjoy this too.
Unlike his other books, Seveneves is set in contemporary times on a realistic Earth.
Well, the key event that sets off the story is the moon inexplicably exploding one day.
The next two sections of the book describe how humanity might realistically react to this and involve realistic technology.
The final section of the book is much more fantastic and speculative, it's set thousands of years later than the first sections and explores how things play out in the long-long term.
I've read other reviews from readers who don't like this shift in the final section, I enjoyed it though.

I think there is a downside to the contemporary realistic setting; I think the book might age rapidly and seem dated to future readers.
For example, one of the characters is a fictional stand-in for Neil deGrasse Tyson, the popular science writer.
If/when Mr. Tyson falls out of popular consciousness, will this character make sense?
Perhaps the character only works because I know what kind of character Stephenson is trying to write from extratextual sources.

The Tyson stand-in also typifies another source of unease I have with the book.
I can describe all of the Neal Stephenson books I've read as "nerd candy".
They take topics that are fun and nerdy; math, science, cryptography, parallel universes, computers, and so on, and blend them together in a coherent way that tickles the reader's brain.
This Tyson stand-in is another example of that technique, but Mr. Tyson is a personality rather than a fun scientific topic like the ones I listed.
At this point Stephenson is capitalizing on people's enjoyment of "scienceism" rather than writing science fiction.
By "scienceism" I mean the trend you see on Facebook and other media where people glorify "scientific" viewpoints and figures as a cultural phenomenon with no regard to actual science.
I think there's a disturbing trend in society to use "science" to justify preexisting political opinions or to cast "unscientific" viewpoints into some outgroup that isn't worth engaging with.
Of course none of this "scienceism" has nothing to do with the dispassionate and methodological pursuit of truth (ie science).
The fact that people confuse science and "scienceism" disturbs me, and I'm mildly disturbed by the way this book seems to cash in on "scienceism".

Perhaps I'm making too much of this.
On the whole the book is a fun read and I enjoyed reading it.
There's stuff about orbital-mechanics, asteroid mining, space stations and robots.

If you've never read and Neal Stephenson perhaps start with Anathem or Cryptonomicon.

I don't expect to reread this book.


###Rendezvous with Rama - Arthur C. Clark
I read this while biking across the United States.
This isn't really relevant to my review of the book, but it is notable that I read a book about an exciting adventure while I was on an exciting adventure of my own.
I got this book from the library in Alma, Colorado.
A section of the library there is essentially a giant-sized "little free library", you can take books and leave books without any checkout process and with no expectation that you'll bring the book back.

Rendezvous with Rama is a low-plot book, instead it's all about setting up a cool situation to explore and think about.
In the book, a mysterious object dubbed Rama enters the solar system from interstellar space.
It seems to be of unnatural origin so a team of astronauts is sent to check out the object before it whizzes on its way out of the solar system.

Rama, apparently some kind of ancient spacecraft, turns out to be fascinating, and it's fun to follow along as the astronauts explore it.
Despite its age this book has aged well, the ideas in the book have been revisited by more recent fiction but I don't think this takes anything away from the book.
For example Rama spins to simulate gravity, a common idea in sci-fi, but the specifics are interesting and explored in detail.

As I mentioned the book doesn't emphasize its narrative.
The characters are flat and I didn't care about any of them really, they were simply windows into the scenario.
The book mentioned some details that weren't explored further and probably could have been left out.
For example the astronauts brought a crew of super-intelligent monkeys along on the trip as menial assistants.
They were mentioned once and never again, so they feel like a pointless and goofy addition to the book.
Another vestigial detail is the captain of the astronauts has two wives, one on Mars and one on Earth.
Maybe Clark included this detail because it's edgy and cool, but since the book doesn't explore social matters at all it seems like a pointless addition.

Overall though the book is very focused on exploring Rama, and that is very interesting.
The book does have a bit of a pulp-fiction feel, and the ending sets the stage for a trilogy which feels cheesy to me.

I finished reading this book in as I was passing through eastern Kansas, I left it on the bookshelf of a church I stopped in at.

I might read this again, after I work through other sci-fi classics.


###Roughing It - Mark Twain
I also read this while on my bike ride across the United States, and this is another adventure book.
I got this form the free book shelf at the public library in Damascus, Virginia.
The Appalachian trail passes through Damascus so I bet lots of travellers get books from the free shelf.

Roughing It is the autobiographical account of Mark Twain's travels to and life in the West, 1861-67.
First he travelled to Nevada and a few years later he moved on to San Francisco.
Some editions continue past this and include Twain's writing about his travels to the Sandwich Islands (now Hawai'i), but my edition ended in California.

The book is a very entertaining window into the past.
I've been to or passed through some of the places mentioned in the book which made it even more interesting.
There was lots of mentions of Mormon history, and there's an entire chapter about Twain's time in Salt Lake City and meeting Brigham Young.
From there he settled in Virginia City, Nevada and was a silver prospector.
That didn't pan out, so he got into journalism, and that took him to larger cities and eventually San Francisco.

I'd recommend this book on the merits of the writing and of the interestingness of the history.
There's a ton of fascinating anecdotes about the people and times.
I might read this again.


###Travels with Charlie - John Steinbeck
Another travel log!
This is an account of a road trip Steinbeck and his dog went on in 1960.
The trip circumnavigated the United States, beginning at Steinbeck's home in Long island and heading first to Maine and then heading around the country in a counterclockwise direction.

I thought the pacing of the book was odd.
The first few hundred miles of the journey were recounted in great detail, but after that the narrative leapt great distances.
I suppose the novelty of travel wore off after a while and Steinbeck's threshold for notability increased.
I was a bit disappointed by this because the beginning of the book was very strong.
I read this book immediately after the conclusion of my epic bike trip and while on my long train ride home from Atlanta to San Francisco, and Steinbeck's characteristically poetic descriptions of travel spoke to me then.

The stories and descriptions in the later parts of the book were good too, just not as consistently good.
Through anecdotes Steinbeck describes the state of American people and society, and how those had changed in his life.
The major factors he visited were cultural homogenization, and the effects of changing economics and technology.
The book was fairly pessimistic but this is not a fault of the book.
The years that followed (the trip was in 1960) were in fact tumultuous and I think the trends Steinbeck identified were factors.

The end of the book included a comparatively long description of his visit to New Orleans.
There were daily protests at a recently integrated school there and Steinbeck went to see one.
This is the most concrete exploration of societal sickness in the book.

After reading the book, I learned that the academic/critical consensus on the book is that many of the details and stories in the book were fabricated by Steinbeck.
Recent editions of the book mention this in the introduction, but the audiobook I listened to didn't mention this.
I don't think this affects my impression of the book much.

I enjoy Steinbeck's prose and I'd recommend this book to anyone else who does.
I don't expect to reread this.
This book has encouraged me to add Steinbeck's The Winter of our Discontent to my reading list.
That novel was published a year after Travels with Charlie and I understand that it explores similar themes.


###The Bell Jar - Sylvia Plath
I read the first half (approximately) of this book in audiobook form.
That was a miserable slog.
The reader was good but progressing through this book at spoken-word speed was agonizing.
I wouldn't have been able to finish the book if I hadn't switched to a paper book, and I'm glad I did finish the book.

The book is agonizing because it's the first-person story of a very depressed person, and its very real because its based closely on the author's actual life.
And the author is good at descriptive writing.
During the book the narrator's life gradually implodes, culminating a mental breakdown and commitment to a psychiatric hospital.
The story continues for awhile after she leaves the hospital.

The book is a difficult read, in exchange for that I gained empathy for the struggle the author describes.
I think personal tragedies like the one in the book are common, but that they are almost invisible to who aren't affected.
I think that it's valuable to reminded of the full breadth of human experience and this book is a very powerful description of one slice of that experience.

I should point out that the narrator isn't defined exclusively by her mental health issues.
The descriptions of coming of age, gender roles, socialization, sexuality, education, and realizing personal potential are also very good.

This book is also an interesting window into society in the mid 1950s, when the book is set.
Fortunately feminism has progressed since then.


###The Extended Phenotype - Richard Dawkins
A couple years back I read The Selfish Gene by Dawkins (I forgot to include it my reading log it looks like).
In the book, just about every time he got to talking about something really interesting, there'd be a footnote that said, "if you want to learn more about this read my later book which goes into more detail."

The Extended Phenotype is that book.
The goal of the book is to get the reader into a mental framework where the gene is the unit of natural selection.
This viewpoint is both accurate, and useful for understanding a lot of things about biology.
The title of the book, and the real point, is that the phenotype of an organism includes things outside of the cell wall/bark/skin of an organism, and that these phenotypic expression of a gene are naturally selected the same way that conventional phenotypes (like eye color) are. That's a fascinating idea, but really most of the book is laying the groundwork of the gene centered view that's necessary for understanding the extended phenotype.

The book is dense, it has many fewer fun animal facts than The Selfish Gene.
Instead there are many more mathematical descriptions and though experiments.
That doesn't mean there are no examples from biology, there's some cool stuff about cuckoo birds and other parasitic behavior.

I think the book accomplished its goal of conveying a gene-centric view of biology.
In more recent reading of pop-biology articles and books I noticed that I'm on guard against sloppy explanations involving natural selection.

I enjoyed the book.


###Diaspora - Greg Egan
This is hard sci-fi.
The book begins with a psychedelic account of a computer program becoming sentient.
The setting is the far future, long after some global cataclysm, that most people survived by uploading themselves into computers somehow.
At the point the story begins several societies of conscious computer programs are living in an internetwork of computers distributed around the solar system.
By the point where book ends the computer programs have spread themselves across the multiverse in order to protect themselves from a cataclysm that nearly wiped out the solar system.

Along the way there's a bunch of exciting math, string theory (this book was written in the 90s), and biology.

I liked the book and would recommend it.
I might read it again, but first I'd like to read more by Egan.


###Night - Elie Wiesel
This is similar to The Bell Jar; it's a slightly embellished account of the author's actual experiences, it's agonizing, and it builds the reader's empathy to a tragic part of the human experience.
Night is about the holocaust though.

The book is short, I read it in one sitting.
It's well written, I'd recommend reading it.

###Other Minds - Peter Godfrey-Smith
####The Octopus, The Sea and The Deep Origins of Consciousness
