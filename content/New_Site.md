title: New Site!

I've been wanting to replace my old WordPress blog for awhile, so for the past
couple of months I've been writing a [static site
generator](https://github.com/pmallory/StaticSite) in my spare time. Since
perfect is the enemy of good enough I've decided to switch the site over to my
generator now even though the code isn't as clean as I'd like and there are
still some features I want to add (an atom feed in particular).

There were a few useful tools I used in the process of making this site:

* SimpleHTTPServer:
  <pre>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</pre>
  Run this in any directory and you've got an instant web server for testing. It
  prints requests to stdout, serves  simple index pages for directories without
  an index file, serves useful error pages, and is convenient as can be.
* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS) 
  CSS has gotten way better since I first used it in my GeoCities days, and so
  have the resources that explain how to use it well.
* [border-radius.com/](http://border-radius.com/)
  Originally this site looked like butt. Then I added rounded corners and 
  suddenly it looked hip and modern!
